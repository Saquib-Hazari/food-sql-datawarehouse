üèÜ Script: Gold Layer ‚Äì Star Schema Population (Dimension & Fact Tables)
üìä Purpose : Transforms and loads cleaned Silver Layer data into analytical 
             Gold Layer tables using a dimensional model (star schema).

üß± Tables Populated:
    1. gold.dim_customers ‚Äì Enriched customer dimension combining CRM + feedback + marketing
    2. gold.fact_sales     ‚Äì Central fact table capturing sales and payment events
    3. gold.dim_products   ‚Äì Product dimension derived from food catalog

üîç Key Transformations:
    - Surrogate keys (`*_sk`) generated via ROW_NUMBER for dimensional modeling
    - Denormalization of CRM and ERP sources for optimized dashboard querying
    - Left joins used to preserve referential integrity where applicable

‚ö†Ô∏è Assumes Silver Layer tables are already cleaned and deduplicated.
